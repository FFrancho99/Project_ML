# Image Inpainting
This project aims at inpainting missing region(s) of an image based on the remaining pixels using deep learning-based methods. 
For this, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been implemented. 
Its purpose is to generate visually plausible image to fill the missing content.
